This can be fine-tuned to capture context for various NLP tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, text classification, sentence embedding, interpreting ambiguity in the text etc.
Earlier language-based models examine the text in either of one direction which is used for sentence generation by predicting the next word whereas the BERT model examines the text in both directions simultaneously for better language understanding. BERT provides contextual embedding for each word present in the text unlike context-free models (word2vec and GloVe) (Khurna 2023, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13428-4).

                <div class="definition">Chunking is a process of separating phrases from unstructured text. Since simple tokens may not represent the actual meaning of the text, it is advisable to use phrases such as "North Africa" as a single word instead of 'North' and 'Africa' separate words. Chunking known as "Shadow Parsing" labels parts of sentences with syntactic correlated keywords like Noun Phrase (NP) and Verb Phrase (VP). Chunking is often evaluated using the CoNLL 2000 shared task. (Khurna 2023, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13428-4). Entry created by Johannes Muff</div>

                <div class="definition">Collections of structured linguistic data that serve as essential resources in NLP and computational linguistics. These corpora, often comprising written texts or transcribed speech, are used to train, test, and benchmark NLP models. There are various types of corpora, each designed to meet different linguistic needs. Annotated corpora, contain added metadata such as part-of-speech tags, syntactic parse trees, or named entity labels, thus enriching plain text with meaningful linguistic markers. This type of corpus is essential for supervised machine learning tasks in NLP, as annotations provide structured data that help models learn specific linguistic features. In contrast, unannotated corpora offer raw text, useful for unsupervised approaches or for creating pre-training datasets in tasks like language modeling. Other types of corpora include parallel corpora, which are aligned text pairs in multiple languages, invaluable for training machine translation models; reference corpora, which represent general language use across various social and situational contexts; and speech corpora, which contain recorded audio paired with transcriptions for developing speech recognition models. Corpora are fundamental for creating robust NLP systems, as they provide real-world language samples that reflect the diversity and complexity of human language. Popular corpora like Penn Treebank, Europarl, and Google's Common Crawl are widely used across academia and industry, enabling advancements in tasks from sentiment analysis to machine translation​ (Khurana et al., 2022).

                <div class="term">Discourse Analysis</div>
                <div class="definition">Discourse Analysis in NLP examines how individual sentences relate to each other within a larger text, aiming to identify patterns of cohesion and coherence that help form a unified message. Unlike syntax and semantics, which operate at the sentence level, discourse analysis operates at the level of multiple sentences or even paragraphs. It is integral in understanding narrative flow, logical connections, and the thematic structure of texts, making it indispensable for applications such as document summarization, question answering, and machine translation. Key components of discourse analysis include anaphora resolution, which determines what pronouns like "he" or "it" refer to, and coreference resolution, identifying all expressions in a text that refer to the same entity. These tasks help maintain coherence, as they link entities across sentences and ensure that relationships within the text are understood in context. Additionally, discourse analysis often uses discourse markers (e.g.: "however," "therefore") to understand transitions between ideas. By connecting sentences and sections of text meaningfully, discourse analysis enables NLP systems to better interpret nuanced text, facilitating tasks that require understanding the relationship between statements. In practical applications, it enables systems to generate more coherent responses in dialogue systems, create accurate summaries in summarization tools, and retain intended meaning across translated texts, enhancing the overall quality of language processing​ (Khurana et al., 2022).

                <div class="definition">The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a stochastic model in which a system is represented by a Markov chain (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) with unobserved (hidden) states. An HMM can therefore be considered the simplest special case of a dynamic Bayesian network.
Modeling as a Markov chain means that the system randomly transitions from one state to another, with the transition probabilities depending only on the current state and not on previously occupied states. Additionally, it is assumed that the transition probabilities remain constant over time. However, in an HMM, the states themselves are not directly observable; they are hidden. Instead, each of these internal states is associated with observable output symbols that occur with certain probabilities depending on the state. The primary task is often to derive probabilistic statements about the hidden states based on the observed sequence of emissions.
Important application areas include speech and handwriting recognition, computational linguistics and bioinformatics, spam filtering, gesture recognition in human-machine communication, physical chemistry, and psychology.

                <div class="definition">The branch of linguistics focused on the structure and formation of words. It explores the smallest units of meaning in language (morphemes), which include >>roots<<, >>prefixes<<, and >>suffixes<<. E.g.: the word "un-/believe/-able" (prefix: un-, root: believe, suffix: -able). Morphology is fundamental in NLP, as it aids in understanding word formation, meaning, and grammatical function within sentences. There are two main types of morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes. Free morphemes, like "book" or "run", can stand alone as words, while bound morphemes, such as "-ed" or "pre-", cannot exist independently and must attach to other morphemes. Morphology also distinguishes between inflectional morphemes, which modify a word's grammatical category (e.g.: "talk" > "talked"), and derivational morphemes, which change a word's meaning or part of speech (e.g.: "happy" > "happiness"). In NLP, morphological analysis is key to tasks like lemmatization, which reduces words to their base forms, and morphological segmentation, which breaks down words into morphemes. This analysis helps systems to better understand word variations and context, enhancing the accuracy of tasks such as machine translation, text analysis, and information retrieval by capturing nuanced changes in word meaning and usage​ (Khurana et al., 2022).

                <div class="definition">Naive Bayes Classifiers are probabilistic algorithms that apply Bayes' Theorem to classify data by predicting the probability of a label given certain features. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), these classifiers are commonly used in text classification tasks such as spam detection and sentiment analysis. Naive Bayes operates by assuming that the features (e.g., words in a document) are conditionally independent of each other given the class label, which simplifies calculations. Despite this "naive" assumption of independence, Naive Bayes Classifiers are effective in practice due to their simplicity, efficiency, and relatively high performance on textual data.

                <div class="definition">Neural networks (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN) are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of multiple interconnected "neurons" organized in layers, enabling them to recognize complex patterns in data. Neural networks have significantly advanced NLP applications by learning multilayered features from data.
Key Concepts:
Neurons: Each artificial neuron receives input features, assigns weights to them, and outputs the result to the next layer. The network adjusts these weights during training to recognize specific patterns in the data.
Layers: Neural networks typically have an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers process the data through multiple transformations, allowing the model to learn more complex features.
Backpropagation: This is a training method in which the network's prediction error is fed back into the network to adjust the neuron weights, improving the model over time.
Specific Architectures: RNNs, LSTMs, and CNNs are all specific types of neural networks tailored for different kinds of tasks: RNNs and LSTMs are suited to sequential data where temporal or structural order is important. CNNs, on the other hand, are well-suited to recognizing local patterns in data, such as in texts, where particular word combinations influence classification.

The process begins with scanning the document and converting it into a simplified black-and-white image, followed by preprocessing to clean and align the image. Text recognition then occurs through pattern or feature recognition, where the software identifies characters by comparing them to known fonts or by analyzing their structural features. The document layout is also analyzed to identify blocks of text, tables, and images, and the recognized text is stored in a digital, editable format. This technology eliminates manual data entry, making it easier to edit and repurpose content from physical documents.

This procedure is also known as grammatical tagging and is often complicated by the ambiguity of terms such as the word "might", which can function as an auxiliary verb expressing permission and possibility or as a noun referring to power and authority (Chiche & Yitagesu, 2022) [1-3]. This practice, which can encompass up to 30 individual POS categories, is a customary upstream task in NLP (Zhang & Teng, 2021) [6].

                <div class="definition">A self-attention mechanism is a core component of Transformer models, enabling them to weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequence relative to each other. It calculates attention scores that determine how much focus should be given to specific tokens or elements in the sequence when processing and encoding the data. This mechanism allows Transformers to model contextual relationships between tokens effectively, irrespective of their positions in the sequence.

                <div class="definition">A task of NLP centered on assigning semantic roles to words and phrases as arguments related to the predicate, or main verb phrase of a sentence composed of a verb as well as associated objects and modifiers (Ariyanto et al., 2024) [57918]. In comparison to other forms of Information Extraction (IE) such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifying proper nouns as entities or Relation Extraction (RE) dedicated to correlations between words in sentences, SRL's focus on predicate-argument structures provides a more detailed analysis of a text via both syntactic and semantic information (Ariyanto et al., 2024) [57918]. A common method of visualizing SRL results is a parse tree, in which nodes mark different arguments of a predicate, and one recent example of semantic analysis research is The Proposition Bank, also known as PropBank (Khurana et al., 2022) [3724]. – Entry created by Natasha Anderson – References: Ariyanto, A.

                <div class="definition">A process of extracting sentiments from a text that is essential to NLP (Khurana et al., 2022) [3723]. Also known as opinion mining, this analysis method can vary in complexity from sentiment classification using the categories negative, neutral, or positive to more descriptive techniques such as targeted sentiment, which investigates the text's opinion regarding a target entity (Zhang & Teng, 2021) [17]. Examples of recent projects employing sentiment analysis are Sentiment140, classifying over 1.6 million tweets as negative, neutral, or positive according to emotion conveyed in the messages (Khurana et al. 2022) [3730], as well as Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), evaluating the emotional content of movie reviews on the sentence level and visualizing the findings via parse trees (Socher, 2013). – Entry created by Natasha Anderson – References: Khurana, D., Koli, A., Khatter, K. & Singh, S.

                <div class="definition">Syntax is the part of linguistics which refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a specific order. It contains the rules according to which a grammatical sentence or a grammatical phrase can be put together. These rules differ from language to language. A change of the sytactic structure of a sentence or phrase can result in a different meaning e.g. in the sentence "ram beats shyam in a competition" and "shyam beats ram in a competition".
